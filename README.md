# BT2201 Task Lancashire Student Services

## How to use this repository

Please do all your work for the _Lancashire Student Services_ assignment in this repository. 

Your website should be published in your bimserver2.com web space. The code from your GitHub repositories and the code on the server **have to be identical**.

Please comment your code, especially if you use functions you haven't learned in class, but from other sources, e.g. books.

If you want to submit additional documentation please add it to your repository, preferably as a markdown file. Please don 't add zip files to your repository.  

**Commit early, commit often**. That way you don’t lose code if something goes wrong and it’s easier to show that you have written the code yourself.

You have to work individually, not with other students, and shouldn't show the final version of your files to other students, e.g. on the module discussion board.
